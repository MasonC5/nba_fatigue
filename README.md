# nba_fatigue
Built a pre-game NBA fatigue risk model using publicly available data to estimate the likelihood of efficiency underperformance based on cumulative minutes, schedule density, and rest. The model uses only information available before tipoff, avoids data leakage, and focuses on risk stratification rather than noisy single-game prediction.
